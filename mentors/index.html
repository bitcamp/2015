  <h3>Check-In</h3>
  <p>
    In the lobby of Cole Field House are tables for checking in. You can check
    in at any table and say you are a mentor. Organizers will get you hooked up
    with a yellow bandana, the identifying “badge” for mentors. Please wear this
    bandana visibly throughout the weekend so that you can be identified as a
    mentor by security, hackers, and organizers. (Sponsors checking in should
    mention if they have signed up for a mentor - they will wear two bandanas.)
  </p>
  <h3>Mentoring</h3>
  <p>
    Throughout the weekend you may be contacted by hackers via email or text.
    Even if you don’t get contacted feel free to roam around and ask what
    they’re working on. The majority of hacking will be taking place on the
    floor of the stadium.
  </p>
  <h3>Storage</h3>
  <p>
    If you are not part of a sponsoring company or a hacker, an additional area
    will be provided for mentors to hang out and store their belongings. It will
    be located by the tunnel. Feel free to drop by and store your stuff.
  </p>
  <h3>Questions</h3>
  <p>
    If you have any questions, you can ask any Bitcamp organizer (red bandanas)
    for more information.
